# Hello!
Hi to my personal git repository for attempt of solution for your tech test :-) 


Future Steps:

-  array/map of databases + collections for reduction in repetition and best practise than repeating code 
-  store state file in bucket
-  variablise username
-  eventually use assumed roles for connecting, ensuring no plain txt credentials are printed/stored any where. 


Hope this makes some sense of the requirements of your technical test and that though I admit I have limited terraform knowledge that I atleast hope to have the general gist of the aim of this test... even if my own implementation is not the most abiding by oop principals or best practises.
